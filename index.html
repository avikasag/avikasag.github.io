  <h1>Hello, I'm Ankit Vikas Agrawal</h1>
  <p>I am Ankit Vikas Agrawal, a passionate Data Science professional with a strong foundation in data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering. Currently, I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Data Science as major and Business Application as minor at Stevens Institute of Technology, where I have gained hands-on experience in applying data-driven techniques to solve real-world business problems. 

With 2 years of experience at Capgemini, I advanced from an Analyst to a Senior Analyst, collaborating with U.S.-based clients on automation, software development, and data analysis projects. I successfully implemented an automated monitoring system that reduced manual workload by 80% and created 40+ custom reports using ABAP and Fiori. My expertise extends to tools like Python, SQL, ABAP, Jira, C, and Excel for data extraction, cleaning, and visualization. I have a proven track record of developing KPI dashboards and streamlining project efficiencies.

I am detail-oriented, with excellent communication skills, and thrive in team environments. My ability to manage time effectively and solve complex problems allows me to deliver impactful results under tight deadlines. I aim to leverage my technical skills and soft skills in a Data related role where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making and help organizations unlock valuable insights from their data.

I am eager to bring my analytical mindset and expertise to a dynamic team, contributing to innovative solutions and continuously learning from industry experts.</p>
