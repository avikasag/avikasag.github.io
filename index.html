  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I collaborated with cross-functional teams to understand business objectives and translate them into data-driven solutions, improving project outcomes. I analyzed requirements, prepared effort estimations, and resolved many Jira, SNOW, Heat, and Service now tickets daily, contributing to smoother project workflows. My work involved creating data visualization dashboards in AppDynamics using CSV and Excel, which enhanced reporting capabilities. I also automated data pipelines using Excel VBA and wrote weekly reports for team reviews, enabling KPI analysis. Additionally, I developed 20+ reports using HANA and ABAP, successfully debugging them with a 100% success rate, and designed a Transport Request system for seamless deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I took on leadership responsibilities, providing knowledge transfer (KT) to my team and ensuring timely completion of courses, which improved team competency. Throughout my tenure, I became proficient in critical monitoring tools such as BW, Qlik Sense, and Qlik View, and handled complex tickets through proactive client interaction. I further honed my skills by implementing automated monitoring with Python, reducing manual tasks by 80%, and creating Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for error resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a development-centric role, I utilized ABAP and Fiori to improve project functionalities and contributed over 100 hours developing reports from scratch. Additionally, I created Transition Repositories for efficient project handovers and resource management. My adaptability was evident as I transitioned into Fiori development, participated in daily stand-ups via Microsoft Teams, and handled email correspondence through Outlook, showcasing my technical proficiency and communication skills.

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Statistical Analysis of Automotive Fuel Economy</h3>
    <p>
      For the "Statistical Analysis of Automotive Fuel Economy" project, I utilized Python on Kaggle to explore and analyze large datasets, converting numeric variables into categorical formats, addressing missing data, and standardizing formats for analysis. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) involved data filtration, cleaning, removing duplicates, and unnecessary columns. Hypothesis tests like the Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Fisher's Exact Test were conducted. Machine learning models such as Random Forest, KNN Regression, and XGBoost Regression were employed to predict fuel economy metrics, demonstrating proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques.
    </p>

    <h3>Attrition AI: Employee Churn Prediction</h3>
    <p>
      In the "Attrition AI: Employee Churn Prediction" project, I worked with the IBM dataset from Kaggle to build a predictive model aimed at identifying employees most likely to leave the company. Using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, supplemented by Cosine similarity, I developed a model with an accuracy rate of 87%. The project was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook, designed to assist HR departments in taking proactive measures by accurately predicting potential employee attrition and improving retention strategies.
    </p>

    <h3>Capgemini L1 Training project</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, I fetched data from predefined tables in the HANA database by writing ABAP reports utilizing SQL-like queries. I developed a repository for seamless code transfer and designed transition code that integrated interactive buttons for enhanced user interaction. Furthermore, I ensured the accuracy of the code through unit testing, achieving a 100% success rate. Additionally, I conducted runtime analysis to optimize performance and ensure the code met all functional requirements. This project showcased my skills in both ABAP development and data extraction from HANA databases.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Discussion Support System</h3>
    <p>
      In the "Technical Discussion Support System" project, I developed a dynamic online platform using JavaScript, PHP, and a robust database system. This platform enabled users to engage in in-depth technical discussions and share expertise, fostering collaborative learning within the technical community. Through rigorous testing and validation, the platform achieved a 90% accuracy rate, ensuring reliable and efficient user interaction. The research findings from this project were successfully published in the International Conference on Information and Communication Networks (IC-ICN), highlighting the innovative contributions made.
